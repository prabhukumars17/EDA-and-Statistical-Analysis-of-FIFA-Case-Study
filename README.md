─
Overview
This Statistics and EDA project is designed to train and test you on basic Data Exploratory and Statistical 
techniques used in the industry today. Apart from bringing you to speed with basic descriptive and 
inferential methods, you will also deep dive into a dataset and perform thorough cleaning and analysis

in order to draw useful business insights from the data. This will expose you to what data scientists do 
most often–Exploratory Data Analysis.
Goals
1. Using the core statistical theoretical concepts and knowledge to solve real time problem 
statements.
2. Visualize a real time industry scenario where one can use these statistical concepts.
3. Detailed data analysis and number crunching using statistics
4. Exhaustive report building using EDA and visualization techniques to help the business 
take decisions using insights from the data
Specifications
Part -I is concept based and walks you through various concepts of descriptive statistics, probability 
distributions and inferential statistics including confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.
Part -II on the other hand is dataset based and explore various data cleaning options, data analysis 
options and using EDA to derive deep and meaningful insights for the business
